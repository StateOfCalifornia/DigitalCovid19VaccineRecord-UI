                Welcome to the Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record portal. Just
                enter a few details below to get a link to a QR code and digital
                copy of your COVID-19 vaccination record. If you want to share
                your proof of vaccination, you can use the electronic version
                youâ€™ll get from the portal or the card you were given at time of
                vaccination.
